# VS Code profile

It's recommended to use the VS Code for this TaxoTagger project. Here the VS Code profile file is provided to ensure the same settings for all developers.

1. `taxotagger.code-profile`: the VS Code profile for the TaxoTagger project. Open the repo in the VS Code and click on the `Code` -> `Settings...` -> `Profile` -> `Import profile...` to import this profile.

2. `vscode_docstring_google_adapted.mustache`: the mustache template for the Google docstring adapted to the VS Code. You don't need to do anything with this file, it's used automatically by the `autoDocstring` extension.
