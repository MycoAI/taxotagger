# Data


These data are used only for demo purpose:

- `database.fasta` is the FASTA data used to build the vector database. This file is exactly same
as [the file from mycoai repo](https://github.com/MycoAI/MycoAI/blob/master/data/test1.fasta).

- `query.fasta` contains the first two DNA sequences of the `database.fasta`. You could actually put any Fungi DNA sequences to this file for demo.
